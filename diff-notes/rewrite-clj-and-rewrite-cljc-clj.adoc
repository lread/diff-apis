The api of the last released version of rewrite-clj was used as a reference for
the rewrite-cljc. As such, you'll notice the apis are almost the same.

There are some differences in arglists. Notably, a macro that rewrite-clj used
left argument names as gensyms. This has been corrected in rewrite-cljc.

There were some features unique to rewrite-cljs (such as paredit and some
positional searching) which were brought over to rewrite-cljc. Also the internal
rewrite-cljs namespaces that were renamed to avoid cljs namespace collisions
also occur in rewrite-cljc (for example rewrite.clj.zip.editz is included and
functionally the same as rewrite.clj.zip.edit).

All other differences are considered internal refactorings.
