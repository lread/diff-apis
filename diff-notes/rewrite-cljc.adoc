The cljs and clj sides of rewrite-cljc differences of note:

1. if we were to exclude api namespaces and functions marked with no-doc we would see no differences,
   we include them because it seems that historically, internal undocumented features have been used
   in rewrite-cljs and rewrite-clj.
1. you'll notice that the clojure api has the ability to deal with files, the clojurescript api does not
2. the clojure api has extra namespaces that would cause collisions on the clojurescript side. These
   are all undocumented internal namespaces, but they have historically been used in rewrite-clj
   and rewrite-cljs.

TODO:

- string-node clj only?
